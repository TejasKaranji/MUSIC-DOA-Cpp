## Introduction

In this guide, we will delve into the implementation of the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) on the phyBOARD®-Polis i.MX 8M Mini to achieve real-time Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation using the Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm. We will discuss the challenges faced and the custom C++ code we developed for evaluating the DOA using random input audio, showcasing the proof of concept on the evaluation board.

## Overview of ALSA on phyBOARD®-Polis i.MX 8M Mini

### What is ALSA?

The Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) provides audio and MIDI functionality to the Linux operating system. It is designed to be efficient, feature-rich, and fully integrated into the kernel space, ensuring low-latency and high-quality audio processing.

### phyBOARD®-Polis i.MX 8M Mini

The phyBOARD®-Polis i.MX 8M Mini is an advanced evaluation board equipped with the NXP i.MX 8M Mini processor. It is designed for multimedia applications, offering robust support for audio processing tasks, making it an excellent choice for implementing real-time audio algorithms like MUSIC for DOA estimation.

## ALSA Implementation for Audio Capture and Processing

### Audio Capture Setup

To capture audio data using ALSA on the phyBOARD®-Polis, we performed the following steps:

1. **Install ALSA Utilities**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install alsa-utils
   ```

2. **Configure Audio Input**:
   We configured the audio capture device using the ALSA `arecord` utility, specifying the format, rate, and device.
   ```bash
   arecord -D hw:0,0 -f S16_LE -r 44100 -c 2 -d 10 input.wav
   ```

3. **Setup ALSA Configuration**:
   The `.asoundrc` file was customized to set up the audio capture parameters, ensuring compatibility with our audio input hardware.

### Audio Processing Pipeline

The audio processing pipeline was set up to manage real-time audio data flow:

1. **Capture Audio**:
   Audio data was continuously captured from the microphones connected to the evaluation board using ALSA.

2. **Buffer Management**:
   Captured audio data was stored in circular buffers for real-time access by the MUSIC algorithm.

3. **Pre-Processing**:
   The captured audio was pre-processed to remove noise and enhance signal quality using filtering techniques implemented in C++.

## Implementation of the MUSIC Algorithm for DOA Estimation

### What is the MUSIC Algorithm?

MUSIC (Multiple Signal Classification) is a high-resolution algorithm used for estimating the direction of arrival (DOA) of multiple signals impinging on an array of sensors. It is particularly effective in distinguishing signals with close DOAs, making it ideal for applications requiring precise angle estimation.

### Challenges in Real-Time Implementation

Implementing the MUSIC algorithm in real-time posed several challenges:

1. **Computational Complexity**:
   MUSIC requires eigenvalue decomposition of the covariance matrix, which is computationally intensive.

2. **Low Latency Requirements**:
   Real-time processing demands low latency to ensure accurate and timely DOA estimation.

3. **Resource Constraints**:
   The i.MX 8M Mini has limited computational resources, requiring efficient code optimization.

### Custom C++ Code Development

To address these challenges, we developed a custom C++ codebase to implement the MUSIC algorithm on the phyBOARD®-Polis i.MX 8M Mini:

1. **Audio Data Acquisition**:
   The code integrates with ALSA to continuously acquire audio data from multiple microphones.

2. **Covariance Matrix Calculation**:
   The covariance matrix of the captured audio signals is computed in real-time, serving as the foundation for the MUSIC algorithm.

3. **Eigenvalue Decomposition**:
   The code performs eigenvalue decomposition using optimized linear algebra libraries to enhance performance.

4. **DOA Estimation**:
   The MUSIC algorithm is applied to the decomposed matrix to estimate the DOA of the incoming signals. The angles are updated in real-time, providing continuous DOA tracking.

5. **Code Snippet**:
   Here’s a simplified version of the custom C++ code used for DOA estimation:
   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   #include <vector>
   #include <eigen3/Eigen/Dense>
   #include "alsa/asoundlib.h"

   using namespace Eigen;

   void captureAudio(std::vector<VectorXf>& audioData);
   VectorXf estimateDOA(const std::vector<VectorXf>& audioData);

   int main() {
       std::vector<VectorXf> audioData;
       captureAudio(audioData);
       VectorXf doa = estimateDOA(audioData);
       std::cout << "Estimated DOA: " << doa.transpose() << std::endl;
       return 0;
   }

   void captureAudio(std::vector<VectorXf>& audioData) {
       // Code to capture audio using ALSA and store in audioData
   }

   VectorXf estimateDOA(const std::vector<VectorXf>& audioData) {
       // Code to estimate DOA using MUSIC algorithm
       MatrixXf covarianceMatrix = computeCovariance(audioData);
       SelfAdjointEigenSolver<MatrixXf> solver(covarianceMatrix);
       VectorXf doa = computeMUSIC(solver.eigenvectors());
       return doa;
   }
   ```
